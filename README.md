# Developer Diary


## Update all Python Packages

Open powershell and paste:
```bash
pip freeze | %{$_.split('==')[0]} | %{pip install --upgrade $_}
```


## Pre-Project Process

1) [Make a new GitHub repo](https://github.com/new)

2) Copy the bash code of `â€¦or create a new repository on the command line`

3) Make a local dir for the project files and open Git Bash there

4) Paste the copied bash code whose template is the following:
```bash
git init
echo "# Repository Name" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "init + readme"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin HTTPS_URL ("https://github.com/username/repository-name.git")
git push -u origin main
```


## Go to i-th (a Previous) Commit

1) Copy commit hash using:
```bash
git log
```

2) Paste:
```bash
git reset copied_commit_hash
```

3) 
Either add the (new) changes and commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
```
Or restore the committed changes of copied_commit_hash:
```bash
git restore .
```

4) Upload:
```bash
git push --force
```
`--force` because remote had the commits that we have reset locally


## Overwrite Last Commit

1) Add the changed files: (if there aren't any changed files, then the following steps will just change the commit message)
```bash
git add .
```

2) Commit the changes:
```bash
git commit --amend -m "new commit message"
```

3) Upload:
```bash
git push --force
```


## GitHub Contribution Process with Examples

1) Go to the repository you want to contribute, and fork

2) Open Git Bash, clone the forked repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samyak1409/first-contributions.git
```

3) Add the remote-upstream (remote-origin is your (forked) repo, upstream-origin is repo from which you have forked):
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions.git
```

4) Create a new temp branch for PR and switch to it:
```bash
git branch add-samyak-jain
git checkout add-samyak-jain
```
Single command for this: 
```bash
git checkout -b add-samyak-jain
```

5) Now, make the desired changes in the files

6) Add the changed files, commit, and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Samyak Jain to Contributors list"
git push origin add-samyak-jain
```

8) Go to the repo, compare and create pull request

9) Congrats! You just completed the standard `Fork -> Clone -> Edit -> PR` workflow that you'll encounter often as a contributor!

10) Once the pull request is merged:
- Delete the temp branch:
```bash
git branch -d add-samyak-jain
```
- And then update origin:
```bash
git pull upstream
git push origin
```
